# Applied-Text-Mining-in-Python-Course-Assignments
# Description:
This repository contains Ipython notebooks of assignments I completed in the course [Applied Text Mining in Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-text-mining),
part of [Applied Data Science using Python Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python) from University of Michigan offered by [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/)
## About This Course:
This course will introduce the learner to text mining and text manipulation basics. The course begins with an understanding of how text is handled by python, the structure of text both to the machine and to humans, and an overview of the nltk framework for manipulating text. The second week focuses on common manipulation needs, including regular expressions (searching for text), cleaning text, and preparing text for use by machine learning processes. The third week will apply basic natural language processing methods to text, and demonstrate how text classification is accomplished. The final week will explore more advanced methods for detecting the topics in documents and grouping them by similarity (topic modelling).
# Requirements:
- Python3.

  - nltk.
  - pickle
  - gensim

# Repository go through:
1. There is a main directory in this repository.
2. All the Assignments and projects files in this course are present in Ipyton notebook format.
3. Subdirectory named [readonly](https://github.com/ahmadabdullah407/Applied-Text-Mining-in-Python-Course-Assignments/tree/main/readonly) contains all the necessary files needed for these assignments.
# Final Course Project:
- Final Project of this course is named as [Assignment+4](https://github.com/ahmadabdullah407/Applied-Text-Mining-in-Python-Course-Assignments/blob/main/Assignment%2B4.ipynb) as it was 4th assignment for the course as well.
- This Assignment is divided into 2 parts.
  - For the first part of this assignment,I completed the functions doc_to_synsets and similarity_score were to be used by document_path_similarity to find the path similarity between two documents.
  - For the second part of this assignment, I used Gensim's LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) model to model topics in [newsgroup](https://github.com/ahmadabdullah407/Applied-Text-Mining-in-Python-Course-Assignments/blob/main/readonly/newsgroups) data.
# Reason to upload:
When I was doing this course, It helped me a lot in my understandings and concepts by comparing assignment approach i took and work done by other people. I am very hopefull that this would be the same for someone else.
